# 🛍️ E-commerce Sentiment Analysis

An AI-powered sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for e-commerce product reviews. This application uses state-of-the-art transformer models to analyze the sentiment of customer reviews and provides insights by showing similar reviews from a database.

## 🚀 Features

- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**: Uses pre-trained RoBERTa models fine-tuned for sentiment analysis
- **Similar Review Discovery**: Finds and displays similar reviews using embedding-based search
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive Gradio interface for easy interaction
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast analysis with immediate results
- **Sample Reviews**: Pre-loaded examples to get you started quickly

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Enter Review Text**: Type or paste a product review in the text area
2. **Optional Image**: Upload a product image (feature in development)
3. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze Sentiment" button
4. **View Results**: See the sentiment classification, confidence score, and similar reviews

## 📊 Sentiment Categories

The model classifies reviews into three categories:

- **😊 POSITIVE**: Indicates customer satisfaction and approval
- **😐 NEUTRAL**: Neither strongly positive nor negative sentiment
- **😞 NEGATIVE**: Indicates dissatisfaction or disapproval

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Gradio for interactive web interface
- **Models**: 
  - Sentiment Analysis: `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`
  - Embeddings: OpenAI CLIP for similarity search
- **Backend**: PyTorch, Transformers, FAISS for vector search
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application is part of a larger microservices-based e-commerce sentiment analysis system that includes:

- **Data Collection Service**: Scrapes and collects product reviews
- **Data Processing Service**: Cleans and preprocesses review data
- **Model Training Service**: Trains custom sentiment models
- **Retrieval Service**: Handles similarity search and embeddings
- **Inference Service**: Performs sentiment analysis
- **Frontend Service**: User interface (this Gradio app)

## 📈 Performance

The sentiment analysis model achieves:
- High accuracy on e-commerce review datasets
- Fast inference times (< 1 second per review)
- Robust handling of informal language and product-specific terminology

## 🔄 Continuous Integration/Deployment

This space is automatically updated through GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:

- **Automated Testing**: Runs comprehensive tests on model performance
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- **Automated Deployment**: Direct deployment to Hugging Face Spaces
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment options available

## 📝 Example Reviews

Try these sample reviews to see the system in action:

1. **Positive**: "This product exceeded my expectations! The quality is outstanding and it arrived earlier than expected."

2. **Negative**: "Terrible experience with this item. It broke after one use and customer service was unhelpful."

3. **Neutral**: "The product is okay, but not worth the price. Shipping was fast though."
